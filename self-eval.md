# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
  - This felt really frustrating a lot of the time. I used a lot of the tactics that I had implemented thus far, like taking a break and then coming back to the issue, but I just couldn't seem to figure out what was going on. I found it particularly frustrating when I was trying to research the answer online and feeling like I just wasn't phrasing it right, or that the answers were coming back in another language.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
  - In terms of taking breaks and staying focused, I feel like I'm doing a good job of going back and forth to the material and staying focused, I just wish I was able to figure out how to get less frustrated or do better with my researching when I ran into any roadblocks.
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
  - I learned that it is really helpful to ask for help and talk through things live with another developer, so I want to remember that it's ok to ask for help.
